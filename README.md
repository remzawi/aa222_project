# aa222_project
Repository for my final project "Neural Networks Hyperparamters Optimization" of AA222: Engineering Design Optimization. It compares the use of particle swarm and genetic algorithm with random searvh for tuning the hyerparameters of a convolutional neurl network that performs image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
